## 🚀 Quick Start (10 Minutes)

This application automatically processes Zendesk voice tickets to format phone numbers and match existing users.

## 📦 Files You Need for Railway

You should have these 4 files:

1. **server.js** - Main application code
2. **package.json** - Dependencies 
3. **railway.json** - Railway configuration
4. **env-file.txt** - Environment variables (rename to .env)

---

## 🔧 Step 1: Prepare Files

### Create a folder called `zendesk-phone-processor`

Put these files in it:
- server.js
- package.json
- railway.json

### Update Environment Variables

Open `env-file.txt` and update this line:
```
ZENDESK_EMAIL=your-email@elotouchcare.com
```

Change to your actual admin email, then save as `.env`

Your file should look like:
```
ZENDESK_SUBDOMAIN=elotouchcare
ZENDESK_EMAIL=admin@elotouchcare.com  ← UPDATE THIS!
ZENDESK_API_TOKEN=AItwPQ8Jdd5pVqaX9ZQYzoxRlf8SCr0ha3FK9AhX
PORT=3000
```

```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-22T...",
  "service": "zendesk-phone-processor"
}
```

If you see this, Railway is working! ✅

## 🎯 Step 6: Configure Zendesk Webhook

### Go to Zendesk Admin

1. Login to https://elotouchcare.zendesk.com
2. Click gear icon → Admin Center
3. Navigate: Apps and integrations → Webhooks → Webhooks
4. Click "Create webhook"

### Configure Webhook

**Connection Type**:
```
Select: Zendesk events
```

**Event Selection**:
```
Select: Ticket Created
```

**Basic Info**:
```
Name: Phone Processor - Voice Tickets
Description: Processes voice ticket phone numbers
```

**Endpoint URL**:
```
https://YOUR-RAILWAY-URL.up.railway.app/webhook/ticket-created
```
⚠️ Replace `YOUR-RAILWAY-URL` with your actual Railway domain!

**Authentication**:
```
None (for now)
```

Click "Create webhook" ✅

### Test the Webhook

1. In webhook details, click "Test webhook"
2. Select "Ticket Created" event
3. Click "Send test"
4. Should return: 200 OK ✅

---

## 📞 Step 7: Test with Real Call

1. Call your Zendesk support number
2. Hang up or leave voicemail
3. Check the created ticket in Zendesk:
   - Phone field should show: `+1XXXXXXXXXX`
   - Custom field 31133639456535 should be populated
   - If existing user: requester updated
   - If new user: phone saved in profile

4. Check Railway logs:
   - Should show "Processing ticket..."
   - Should show "Formatted phone: +1..."
   - No errors

---

## 🎉 Success!

If everything works:
✅ Voice tickets automatically processed
✅ Phone numbers formatted to +1XXXXXXXXXX
✅ Existing users matched by phone
✅ No duplicate users created
✅ Clean data!

---

## 🔍 How It Works

1. **Call comes in** → Zendesk creates ticket
2. **Webhook fires** → Sends ticket to Railway
3. **Railway app processes**:
   - Extracts phone: `+13035872087`
   - Searches for existing user with that phone
   - If found: Updates ticket requester
   - If not: Updates auto-created user's phone field
   - Updates custom field 31133639456535
4. **Result**: Clean data, no duplicates!

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Webhook Not Firing
- Check webhook is "Active" in Zendesk
- Verify Railway URL is correct
- Test health endpoint
